# CatanBoardGenerator
Version 0.1 of the Settlers of Catan Board Generator

This is a board generator for the famous game Catan (or Settlers of Catan). I do not own any copyright nor I am related to Catan
or the Catan company. 

I made this generator for fun, and for those who have little tables and cannot shuffle the tiles. 

The features are limited, but with feedback and time I will update this to be more useful.

##Materials assignment
The generator builds the board for you. It assigns 3 ores, 3 bricks, 4 wheat, 4 lumber, 4 sheep, and 1 desert automatically.  
##Starting Point
The generator assigns a starting point on the outside of the board. That's the position of the "A" token.

##TODO
### Adding Dice number to tiles
For now, the generator only assigns the starting point, so you can put the tokens face up (starting from the marked tile).
In a future release, the values will be assigned automatically. 
### Adding Expansion capabilities
The generator can only generate boards for up to 4 players. A future version will include the option to extend the board 
to allow more than 4 players.
